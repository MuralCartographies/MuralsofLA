<p>There are many ways to get started with the murals:</p>


<p>Check out the map and look around. Find out more about the collections and where they are.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0GLYH70A2T7RGQyc0JNNWN0TW8"><b>Download the data</b></a> and try it out in a tool like Palladio or Carto. Palladio helps you to better understand how you might map and visualize the data for your own project. Carto allows for quick and easy mapping.</p>

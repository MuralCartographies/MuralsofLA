<p>There are many ways to get started with the murals:</p>


<p>Just check out the map and look around. Find out more about the collections and where they are.</p>

<p>Download the data and try it out in a tool like Palladio. Palladio helps you to better understand how you might map and visualize the data for your own project.</p>

<p>There are many ways to get started with the murals.</p>

First and foremost, take a look at the data! 

Once you are ready try out a tool like Palladio. Palladio helps you to better understand how you might map and visualize the data for your own project. Carto allows for quick and easy mapping.</p>

<p><a href="http://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/"><b>Getting started with Palladio</b></a> tutorial from Miriam Posner.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/uclamapshare/cartodb-workshop/wiki/4-Palladio"><b>Palladio tutorial</b></a> from a workshop by the UCLA Library and the UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education.</p>

<p>Contact Andy Rutkowski (arutkows at usc.edu) or Stacy Williams (stacyw at usc.edu) to talk more about ideas for using the data and/or request a consultation or workshop</p>

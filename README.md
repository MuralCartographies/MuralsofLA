This site is a resource page for a project around Los Angeles mural collections. The idea for the project emerged during a seminar course at UCLA's Urban Humanities Summer Institute. The idea is fairly simple, bring together as many mural collections from the Los Angeles area and put them on a map, provide the underlying metadata, and give some ideas for how to create your own maps and generally use the data. 

Thanks to:

Wayne Shoaf at USC for providing original metadata for The Robin Dunitz Collecition.
Mark Matney for providing original metadata for the Nancy Tovar collection
Stacy Williams at USC for providing access and answers to original Dunitz archival materials.
Miriam Posner for providing guidance and inspiration, espeically through her DH courses at UCLA.
Yoh Kawano and Albert Kochaphum for countless hours of support and collaboration through UCLA's Institute for Digital Research and Education.

To all the muralists past, present, and future.

This project repository is a resource page for ongoing work around Los Angeles mural collections. The idea for the project emerged during a seminar course at UCLA's Urban Humanities Summer Institute. The idea is fairly simple, bring together as many mural collections from the Los Angeles area as possible and put them on a map, provide the underlying metadata, and give some ideas for how to create your own maps and generally use the data. 

Thanks to:

Wayne Shoaf at USC for providing original metadata for The Robin Dunitz Collecition.
Mark Matney and the Digital Library Program team at UCLA for providing original metadata for the Nancy Tovar Collection.
Stacy Williams at USC for providing answers and guidance to the Robin Dunitz Archive.
Miriam Posner for providing guidance and inspiration, especially through her DH courses at UCLA.
Todd Presner, Jonathan Banfill, and everyone involved in the UHI program. 
Zoe Borovsky and everyone involved in UCLA's DResSUP Program.
Yoh Kawano and Albert Kochaphum at UCLA's Institute for Digital Research and Education for countless hours of support and collaboration.

To all the muralists past, present, and future.
